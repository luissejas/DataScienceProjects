# DataScienceProjects
Here is the submission of my Data Science Projects

The main idea is that each branch is an individual project.

The projects could be split in two: Machine Learning Concepts and Full Projects.

**Full Projects**

NLP_Project1

This project consists of receiving a number of texts from the internet from different age groups.
All of the age groups were split in three categories, we trained some models and created texts.
There is a presentation which gives a better overview.


AvocadoPrices_proj

This project consists of a dataset from kaggle of avocado prices.
There together with a group we clean and explore the data.
Then we pre-process to train machine learning algorithms with it.
Finally we compare different methods to see which is the best fit and also tune it.

**Deep Dive NLP**

IMDB Dataset Project
  Project where a number of NLP models were employed.
 
Kaggle
  On my free time, I might engage into some Kaggle Projects.
