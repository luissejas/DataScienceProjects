It can be reflected in its lack of sentence structure (many times even lack of phrase structure) and lack of context. In contrast, the other two models are able to output partial sentences. One possible explanation is that the sample data of the blogs written by people under 20 covers topics and genres of more variety than the others. Upon our initial inspection of the raw data, we did discover that there are many forms of the blogs of the under-20 age group; for example, some blogs seem to have structures of a survey that consists of very short phrases and informal sentences.\n",

As will be discussed below, one reason for this could be that the training size we use is still relatively small."

    "In short, the `text_analyse` takes a list of texts as input and output a dataframe that stores the scoring from the different standards. One of the constraints of these tests is that they require the input texts to be punctuated. As our models are not able to incorporate punctuations, the input texts here are **manually punctuated** by us, which is part of the reason why the sample size of the texts is very small (only 10 pieces of texts of around 100 words for each model). These texts are generated using the same function throughout the project and therefore we decide not to document it with another notebook.\n",

    "- It has been consistently shown in the example texts generated in Part III and the significance test on readability scores in Part IV that, compared to the other two models, the model trained using blogs written by people under 20 has poorer performance even though the **training data size is the same** for all three models. One of the possible reasons could be that people under 20 are more likely to use slangs and informal words such as \"cuz\" (or \"cus\") instead of \"because\" and \"u\" instead of \"you\", which makes it hard for the model to learn given the limited sample size. Moreover, it could be because that the writing styles and writing formats of people under 20 vary much more than those of the older groups."

In case the reader chose to skip the notebook **(3.1.1) Multi Batch GPU-Under_20.ipynb**, here is the analysis and conclusion from there:\n",

    "    As more subsets of data are fed into the model trained using previous subsets, the performance of the model has become worse (in terms of sentence structure and the context). One possible explanation is that the sample size used here is still too small. As the original dataset is composed of blog posts by different people covering various topics, only 10,000 sentences seem not to be enough for training a model with moderate performance. Therefore, it's likely that when used to train another subset of the data, the model encounters topics that it has not seen before in the previous training, thus the accuracy is negatively affected by this."

    "- After considering the above analysis and our observations of the data as well as the model performance, we believe the following steps in the future will be helpful in improving the modelling:\n",
    "    - Increase the training data sample size.\n",
    "    - Instead of training the model using separate sentences, try to use the entire paragraphs.\n",
    "    - Use better methods for data cleaning: for example, as pointed out in **(2.1) Preprocessing-under 20** in folder `Initial processing`, some blogs of the dataset are not written in English. To solve this, we utilized a very simple filter to save time. However, in later model predictions, it was observed that non-English words are sometimes common in certain cases, indicating that our filter was not able to remove all the non-English texts.\n",
    "    - Incorporate punctuations in the modelling. Not only will this help improve the texts' readability, it will also provide more convenience for further analysis (for example, the readability analysis in this notebook requires punctuations).\n",
